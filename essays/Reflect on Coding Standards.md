## Introduction
In an ever-evolving software development environment, where innovation and efficiency are critical, coding standards play a critical role that is often overlooked. Using ESLint and IntelliJ, I believe that coding standards are often misunderstood and underestimated in the world of software development. While some may think they are just trivial things like indentation style or brace placement, I firmly believe that coding standards are the cornerstone of software engineering quality. I hope my article can make more people pay attention to the importance of coding standards and their role in learning programming languages.
 

## Coding Standards

Asking questions the smart way is an art that can greatly enhance the quality of the answers you receive and the overall experience of both the inquirer and the respondent. To ask a question smartly means to be prepared, clear, and respectful. First and foremost, it's crucial to do your homework. Before posting a question in an online forum or community, invest time in researching the issue independently. Consult relevant documentation, manuals, questions, or search engines to see if your question has already been addressed. This not only demonstrates your commitment to solving the problem but also respects the time and expertise of those who may potentially assist you.

When you do pose a question, ensure it is well-formed. This involves providing context, details, and a clear problem statement. Be specific about what you are trying to achieve, the steps you have taken, and the roadblocks you've encountered. A good question should stand alone, meaning that someone unfamiliar with your problem can understand it without requiring additional information. This not only expedites the response process but also increases the likelihood of receiving relevant and accurate answers.

Additionally, maintain a courteous and respectful tone. Show appreciation for the time and effort that others are investing in helping you. Simple phrases like "Please" and "Thank you for your attention" can go a long way in fostering a positive atmosphere within the online community. Furthermore, after receiving assistance, it's considered good practice to follow up and share the outcome of the problem's resolution. This not only shows gratitude but also contributes to the collective knowledge base, helping future users with similar issues.



1. Consistency:
  Consistent code is easier to read and maintain, making collaboration between developers more efficient. When everyone follows the same set of standards, code reviews go more smoothly and debugging becomes less error-prone. At the same time, consistent formatting and organization make the code easier to understand, especially for beginners. As a result, developers can more effectively study existing code bases and learn from the work of others.

2. Readability:
Well-defined coding standards serve as a common language within the software development community. They enhance the readability of your code so that even developers who don't write the code can understand it. This property proves to be invaluable in long-term software maintenance and knowledge transfer scenarios. In an industry where software often undergoes long periods of change, code that adheres to coding standards remains understandable and adaptable.

3. Reduce errors:
Coding standards can serve as proactive guardians against coding errors. For example, consistent indentation practices help prevent subtle errors related to scope and logic that can easily go unnoticed in code that lacks uniformity. Coding standards make a significant contribution to the reliability and robustness of software by catching potential problems before they escalate into major problems.

4. Learning aids:
I believe that adhering to coding standards can be an effective way to learn a programming language. When we write code according to a set of standards, not only do we produce better code, but we gain a deeper understanding of the language's syntax and best practices.

## ESLint and IntelliJ

ESLint is an open source JavaScript linting tool that is an indispensable companion for developers striving to maintain coding standards. It acts as an automated code analysis tool that scans JavaScript code for deviations from predefined rules.

I think using ESLint with IntelliJ is an opportunity for people learning to program to gain valuable experience. A "green check mark" indicates that the code complies with ESLint rules. The green checkmark is useful because it indicates that their code follows predefined coding standards. This helps maintain code consistency, enhances readability, and reduces the likelihood of common coding errors. At the same time, I think checkmark is very important for future team projects.

At the same time, I also think that getting a green check mark when using ESLint is a really challenging and painful experience, especially when ESLint gives a warning indicating that there is code that needs to be corrected. For a newbie learning programming, this is not just On the technical side, ESLint acts like a ruthless taskmaster, creating an invisible sense of pressure that "forces you" to constantly pursue the green check mark. It serves as an ongoing feedback loop that prompts me to revisit my code and work on improving code quality and adhering to coding standards.



In summary, a green checkmark in ESLint is a great indicator of code quality and compliance with coding standards. While I think the process of getting "buy-in" to ESLint was initially painful, I think ESLint will ultimately help me write cleaner, more maintainable code. This also means that my code follows coding standards, ensuring code consistency and quality.


## Conclusion

In the world of software development, coding standards are more than just a formality. They are the pillars upon which software engineering quality is built. The many benefits of adhering to coding standards include consistency, readability, reduced errors, and increased learning opportunities. Although the process of using ESLint and IntelliJ can be challenging initially, and the process of getting a green checkmark in ESLint can be difficult, a green checkmark is a symbol of code quality and adherence to coding standards. Not only have ESLint and IntelliJ improved the quality of our code over time, but in team projects these tools are integral to ensuring that all contributors move forward according to established standards.

As the field of software development continues to expand and projects increase in scale, the significance of coding standards becomes increasingly evident. Coding standards are as vital as English grammar; they serve as guiding principles for developers in navigating the intricacies of programming languages. These standards ensure that their creations are not only functional but also maintainable and easily comprehensible.
