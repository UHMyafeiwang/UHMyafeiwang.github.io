*Dreams are not only achievable but also inevitable*

The journey to achieve your dreams is dynamic and often challenging. In this pursuit, the virtues of maintaining happiness and unwavering determination play vital roles. The fusion of these two principles—staying happy and never giving up on your dreams—creates a powerful synergy that drives personal growth, innovation, and achievement.


## Happiness in ICS314

I'm currently taking ICS 314 and I'm having fun as I embark on a journey to further develop my computer science skills. Specifically, learn JavaScript, a programming language that poses unique challenges because it differs from languages like Java and C++. The allure of expanding my coding expertise and mastering the language kept me motivated.

 

## Perseverance

One component of the ICS 314 class that really sparked my passion was the JavaScript Coding-centric Workout of the Day (WOD) class. These classes reflect the concept of physical exercise, but instead of targeting muscles, they target my coding skills. WODs are carefully crafted coding challenges that require creativity, problem solving, and efficient implementation using JavaScript. Each WOD presents a unique challenge that requires dissecting the problem, formulating an algorithmic strategy, and translating it into functional code.

## WODs

The Weekly Assessments (WODs) were a regular part of the ICS 314 class and quickly became a source of both dread and excitement for me. These assessments measure my understanding of the material and serve as a litmus test for my progress. While some may find the quizzes nerve-wracking, I enjoy the opportunities they provide. They challenged me to consolidate my learning, identify gaps and consolidate my knowledge. Testing is not just a measure of my ability, it is an important aspect of the learning process that drives me to strive for excellence.

## Practice

The beauty of WODs is their ability to translate the abstract theories and concepts we learn in the classroom into tangible, applicable skills. They bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical ability. Through these challenges, I not only strengthened my problem-solving skills, but also gained a deeper understanding of how to use JavaScript's features to write elegant and efficient code.

## Summary

In conclusion, ICS 314 was a pivotal moment in my computer science journey, and my focus on learning JavaScript symbolized my commitment to growth. The nuances of JavaScript versus Java and C++ can be daunting, but they also represent an opportunity to broaden my horizons and become a well-rounded programmer. Quizzes and WODs, while demanding, were an integral part of shaping me into a more proficient programmer. With each passing week, I am not only accumulating knowledge, but forging a skill set that will undoubtedly shape my future endeavors in the vast field of computer science.
